This is designed with a similar idea to [Tailwind CSS Typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography), but following the design proposed by [Latex.css](https://latex.now.sh/).

To use it, add `latex-style` to a HTML element, in the same way as you would use `prose` with Tailwind CSS Typography.

You can see an example of how this works [here](https://latex-tailwind.vercel.app/)
